the 30th day counting backwards from day 0.



day object Fields: 
* dayNb - contains the day in the sequence 0-29
          a value of 0 is the most recent date. We count backwards, 1 is the 
          day before the most recent, and so on to day 29, the 30th day.

         format: year-month-day

             are included into this sum.

Notes:
= When calculating tracking (moments+day) the field is_edited is taken into consideration. If a row has
an is_edited value equal to 1 it is not considered in the moment+day count.
the following questions are considered in the tracking count: 1,4,6,7,8,25,401,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,24,27,28,34,35

= the answer to question 38 (Flow) is stored in periodDesc, but does not count towards moment+day count
